# 综合写作

##综合写作概述

**1. 考试形式**  

综合写照首先需要用3分钟的时间阅读一篇学术文章，期间可以在草稿纸上做笔记。  
文章结构清晰，一般是总分结构，分为4段。首段表明中心论点，后3段分别为支撑观点的3方面理由。  
3分钟后文章自动隐去，考生将听到一段2分钟左右的听力材料，此材料内容和之前阅读文章的内容有直接联系（目前为止大陆考过的都是反驳关系）。听力材料也大多以4段式结构出现，条理和结构都较清晰。  注意：听力材料只放一遍，无复听机会。  
听力结束后，阅读文章会再次出现在屏幕上，同时开始答题，要求考生对听力和阅读材料中的观点做总结和对比，写作时间20分钟。字数要求为150—225字。

**2. 评分标准 **  
Integrated Writing Rubrics (Scoring Standards)
	
Score 5	  
Task Description: A response at this level successfully selects the important information from the lecture, and coherently and accurately presents this information in relation to the relevant information presented in the reading. The response is well organized, and occasional language errors that are present do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.

4	A response at this level is generally good in selecting the important information from the lecture and in coherently and accurately presenting this information in relation to the relevant information in the reading, but it may have minor omission, inaccuracy, vagueness, or imprecision of some content from the lecture or in connection to points made in the reading. A response is also scored at this level if it has more frequent or noticeable minor language errors, as long as such usage and grammatical structures do not result in anything more than an occasional lapse of clarity or in the connection of ideas.

3	A response at this level contains some important information from the lecture and conveys some relevant connection to the reading, but it is marked by one or more of the following:
	Although the overall response is definitely oriented to the task, it conveys only vague, global, unclear, or somewhat imprecise connection of the points made in the lecture to points made in the reading.
	The response may omit one major key point made in the lecture.
	Some key points made in the lecture or the reading, or connections between the two, may be incomplete, inaccurate, or imprecise.
	Errors of usage and/or grammar may be more frequent or may result in noticeably vague expressions or obscured meanings in conveying ideas and connections.

2	A response at this level contains some relevant information from the lecture, but is marked by significant language difficulties or by significant omission or inaccuracy of important ideas from the lecture or in the connections between the lecture and the reading; a response at this level is marked by one or more of the following:
	The response significantly misrepresents or completely omits the overall connection between the lecture and the reading.
	The response significantly omits or significantly misrepresents important points made in the lecture.
	The response contains language errors or expressions that largely obscure connections or meaning at key junctures, or that would likely obscure understanding of key ideas for a reader not already familiar with the reading and the lecture.

1	A response at this level is marked by one or more of the following:
	The response provides little or no meaningful or relevant coherent content from the lecture.
	The language level of the response is so low that it is difficult to derive meaning. 

0	A response at this level merely copies sentences from the reading, rejects the topic or is otherwise not connected to the topic, is written in a foreign language, consists of keystroke characters, or is blank.
